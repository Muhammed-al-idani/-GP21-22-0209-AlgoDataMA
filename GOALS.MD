I'm going to make a game that I call neighbor.

the game will be in 2D.

there will be mountains there will be mud. the player should be able to get from A to B and find your nearest road around the mountains and mud.

if you go on mud, the player will move very slowly.

there will be an enemy who will try to stop you from reaching the goal.

Im going to make this game from the start i will not import any stuff from the internet.

the goal is that the player can reach the goal without being nighbor with the enemy.

the player have to choose the right steps to make it to the goal if you make wrong steps and end up as a nighbor to the enemy you Lose!.
